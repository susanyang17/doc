One of Spreadsheet's powerful feature is to export its book model as an
Excel file then we can open the file with Microsoft Excel. Besides,
exporting to a file is also the only way to persist a book model
completely and then import it in the future. The following codes
demonstrate how to export a book model to a temporary file with
<javadoc directory="zss">org.zkoss.zss.api.Exporter</javadoc> and make
users download it in a browser:

``` java
public class ExportComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {
    @Wire
    private Spreadsheet ss;
    
    
    @Listen("onClick = #exportExcel")
    public void doExport() throws IOException{
        Exporter exporter = Exporters.getExporter();
        Book book = ss.getBook();
        File file = File.createTempFile(Long.toString(System.currentTimeMillis()),"temp");
        FileOutputStream fos = null;
        try {
            fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
            exporter.export(book, fos);
        }finally{
            if(fos!=null){
                fos.close();
            }
        }
        //generate file name upon book type (2007,2003)
        String dlname = BookUtil.suggestName(book);
        Filedownload.save(new AMedia(dlname, null, null, file, true));
    }
}
```

  - Line 8: Get a default `Exporter` which exports as xlsx format.
  - Line 14: Currently, we only support exporting whole book.

You can get different Exporter by its type:

``` java
Exporters.getExporter();       //get default exporter, xlsx
Exporters.getExporter("xlsx"); //get xlsx exporter
Exporters.getExporter("xls");  //get xls exporter
```
