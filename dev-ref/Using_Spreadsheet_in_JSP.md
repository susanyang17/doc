Keikai spreadsheet can also be embedded into a JSP page by a custom tag
to empower JSP with AJAX. Spreadsheet JSP tag works pretty much the same way as
the spreadsheet ZUL component tag in a ZK application. It supports all the attributes and events.

to interact with Spreadsheet, you can send your own AJAX request in Javascript or use <http://jquery.com>. Then handle AJAX request by
yourself with Spreadsheet API we mentioned in [ Working with Spreadsheet](Working_with_Spreadsheet). We will demonstrate the usage with an example application in the following section.
