title: 'Use Keikai in ZK'
---
ZK is a Java Web Framework created by our mother company Potix. It comes with 200+ Web components and features and helps developers to build Web Applications efficiently.

Using Spreadsheet in ZK is the easiest way, and you can directly benefit
from ZK framework's value including component-based, event-driven
programming model, AJAX detail encapsulation, and hundreds of components.
Of course it requires you to [know some basics about
ZK](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Getting_Started/Get_ZK_Up_and_Running_with_MVC). 

If you already have a different setup and won't be able to use ZK, Spreadsheet can also be
used in JSP or being embeded into an external application. Please read [Using Spreadsheet in
JSP](Using_Spreadsheet_in_JSP).
