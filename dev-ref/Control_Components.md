# MVC in Brief

Keikai is based on ZK Framework and ZK Framework supports the MVC design pattern to develop a web
application. This pattern separates an application into 3 parts:
*Model*, *View*, and *Controller*. The Model is the data that an
application handles. The View is the UI which indicates a ZUL page in a
ZK-based application. The Controller handles events from the UI, controls
the UI, and accesses the Model. For complete explanation, please refer
to [ZK Developer's
Reference/MVC](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC).

# Spreadsheet Properties

Each component is represented by a unique tag name, e.g. Keikai Spreadsheet is a
`<spreadsheet>` in a ZUL page. The easiest way to control a component is
to set a component's properties via a tag's attribute. Each property has
its own purpose, and you can change it by specifying values in a tag's
attribute.

## Excel File Path

The simplest way to load and display an Excel book file is setting
Spreadsheet's `src` attribute to the file path which is a relative URI
with respect to the web application root.

``` xml
<spreadsheet src="/TestFile2007.xlsx" .../>
```

  - In this case, TestFile2007.xlsx is under the web application's root
    folder.

In addition to the file path, some UI parts are configurable like toolbar, formula bar,
sheet bar, and context menu.

## Toolbar

The `showToolbar` attribute controls toolbar's visibility, and it only
accepts boolean literal.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showToolbar="true"/>
```

## Formula Bar

The `showToolbar` attribute controls formula bar's visibility, and it
only accepts boolean literal.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showFormulabar="true"/>
```

## Sheet Bar

The `showSheetbar` attribute controls sheet bar's visibility, and it
only accepts boolean literal.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showSheetbar="true"/>
```

## Context Menu

The `showContextMenu` attribute controls context menu's visibility, and it
only accepts boolean literal.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showContextMenu="true"/>
```

## Selection Visiblility

Default: `true`

When it's `true`, Keikai keeps the selection area visible after opening a
dialog like "Format Cell". Specify `false` to turn off this behavior.

``` xml
<spreadsheet keepCellSelection="false"  .../>
```

If you wish to change the default value to `false`; you can do that by
setting the library property *io.keikai.ui.keepCellSelection* to
`false`. [Read more here](http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Spreadsheet_Essentials/Working_with_Spreadsheet/Configuration#Keep_Cell_Selection)

## Preloaded Column / Row Size

In order to speed up cell rendering, Keikai spreadsheet caches a range of
cell data at client-side to avoid constantly getting data from the server-side when
scrolling. You can adjust this range by `preloadColumnSize` (default:
40) and `preloadRowSize` (default: 60) like:

``` xml
<spreadsheet preloadColumnSize="50" preloadRowSize="50"/>
```

If you specify a larger size, it will make a more smooth scrolling when
moving to adjacent cells. On the other hand, when you scroll out of the
cached range, it takes more time for Keikai to get the next data batch from the server.

### Pasting Lots of Cells Requires Larger Preloaded Size

If you paste lots of cells from Excel which is more than cached range,
Keikai will fail to handle the pasting because it does not have corresponding
cached cell data at the client-side (you should see an error message in
the developer tool / Console tab). If you run into this issue, you should increase
preloaded row/column size according to the expected row/column size for
copy-pasting.

### Underlying Details

There are 3 ranges behind the scene:

1.  **visible range**: the viewport that shows a sheet. By default it is 40
    column \* 50 rows. It changes if you resize a browser window, or
    scrolls the page, etc.

2.  **rendered range**: the range with rendered DOM of cells.
    Spreadsheet could also render hidden rows if the next visible row is
    within the range, e.g. if row 25th\~30th are hidden, but row 31th is
    in the range, then Spreadsheet still renders row 25th\~30th but hides them.
    
3.  **cached range**: the browser cached cell data.

When the visible range moves by user scrolling, Keikai renders DOM of cells
from the cached range. So the rendered range becomes larger. If the cache does
not cover the whole visible range, Keikai will send AU request
(`onZssFetchActiveRange`) to get the data back to the cache.

## MaxRenderedCellSize

It's a threshold to remove cached cell data when scrolling. When you
scroll toward one direction, Spreadsheet will remove cached cell data in
reversed direction. For example, if you scroll toward right (east), it
will remove those cached cells data of the left (west) which are over
the `MaxRenderedCellSize` inside the "cached range" but outside of the
"visible range".

## Max Visible Rows and Columns

The attribute `maxVisibleColumns` controls the maximum visible number of
columns in the Spreadsheet, it must be larger than 0. For example, if you set it to 40, it will display 40 columns: column `A` to column `AN`.

If you set this attribute to 0 or didn't set it, spreadsheet will detect the sheet content and show as more columns as
needed. However, it will show at least 40 columns if you have a smaller sheet.

Similarly, the attribute `maxVisibleRows` controls the maximum visible
number of rows in Spreadsheet. You can use these 2 attributes above to set up
the visible area according to your requirement.

If you set this attribute to 0 or didn't set it, spreadsheet will detect the sheet content and show as more rows as
needed. However, it will show at least 200 rows if you have a smaller sheet.

**Usage:**

``` xml
    <spreadsheet maxVisibleRows="200" maxVisibleColumns="40"/>
```

## Other Inherited Properties

There are other properties inherited from parent component you can set,
such as `width`, or `height`. For the complete list, please look for
those inherited setter methods in the javadoc `io.keikai.ui.Spreadsheet`.

Each **setter** means a corresponding **attribute**, for example:

  - `setWidth()`

``` xml
<spreadsheet width="100%">
```

  - `setHeight()`

``` xml
<spreadsheet height="100%">
```

# Controller

After we create a ZUL page, we can apply a Controller to handle events
and control components of the page. In ZK, the simplest way to create a
Controller is to create a class that extends `org.zkoss.zk.ui.select.SelectorComposer`. For
details, please refer to [ZK Developer%27s
Reference/MVC/Controller](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC/Controller).

**Controller example**

``` java
public class MyComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {
    //omitted codes...
}
```

Then we can apply this controller to a root component of a ZUL page.

**index.zul**

{% highlight java linenos %}
    <window title="My First Keikai spreadsheet Application" 
    apply="io.keikai.essential.MyComposer"
        border="normal" height="100%" width="100%">
        <spreadsheet id="ss"src="/WEB-INF/books/startzss.xlsx"
                height="100%"width="100%"
        maxVisibleRows="150" maxVisibleColumns="40"
         showToolbar="true" showSheetbar="true" showFormulabar="true"/>
    </window>
{% endhighlight %}

  - Line 2: We usually apply a controller on the root component (the
    outermost component) of a ZUL page so that we can gain control of
    all components in a page.
  - Line 4: The component's id, `ss`, can be used as a criteria in
    component selector to get Spreadsheet object in a controller and we
    will describe it in next section.

## Access Components in a ZUL Page

After applying the controller, we can easily get a component object in the
zul with the help of SelectorComposer and manipulate the component to
fulfill our business requirements.

Steps to get a component:

1.  Declare a member variable with the same type as the component you
    wish to get.
2.  Apply the annotation `@Wire` with component selector syntax which
    specifies matching criteria against the components of the page which
    is applied with this controller.

When a ZUL page is applied with a controller, ZK will *wire*
corresponding components object to those variables annotated with
`@Wire` according to component selector.

If you wish to initialize components in a Controller, you should
override `doAfterCompose()`. For complete explanation, please refer to
[ZK Developer%27s Reference/MVC/Controller/Wire
Components](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC/Controller/Wire_Components "wikilink").

Let's see an example to get Spreadsheet component in index.zul:

**@Wire usage**

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class MyComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {

    @Wire
    Spreadsheet ss;
    
    @Override
    public void doAfterCompose(Component comp) throws Exception {
        super.doAfterCompose(comp);  //wire variables and event listeners
        //access components after calling super.doAfterCompose()
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

  - Line 3,4: If you specify nothing in `@Wire`, ZK will use the
    variable name as a component's id to look for matching component in
    the ZUL page. In this case, ZK will try to find a Spreadsheet
    component whose id is `ss` in index.zul.
  - Line 7: Override this method to write initializing code in it.
  - Line 8: Remember to call `super.doAfterCompose()` before you
    access components because parent class wires the components for you.


## Set Spreadsheet Properties by API

After we retrieve a reference to a component, we can use its API to
manipulate a component. The basic usage is to set (or get) a component's
properties. Each Spreadsheet's property listed in previous section has a
corresponding getter and setter. For example,`setShowToolbar()` and `isShowToolbar()` corresponds to the attribute
`showToolbar`. You can read Javadoc for the complete list of getter and
setter.

**Setter usage**

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class MyComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {

    @Wire
    Spreadsheet ss;
    
    @Override
    public void doAfterCompose(Component comp) throws Exception {
        super.doAfterCompose(comp);  //wire variables and event listeners
        //access components after calling super.doAfterCompose()
        if (isConditionOne()){
            ss.setShowToolbar(true);
            ss.setSrc("/books/firstFile.xlsx");
        }
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

  - Line 11,12: Using API allows you to set a component dynamically upon
    different conditions.

## Handling Events

In most scenarios, the controller is usually used to listen to
interested events of Spreadsheet and implement business logic to react
to the events. When a user interacts with a Spreadsheet, it will send
various events according to his actions. Please refer to [Handling
Events](Handling_Events) on how you can listen events in a controller. To implement business logic,
you definitely will need to access Spreadsheet data model. Refer to
sections under [Handling Data Model](Handling_Data_Model) to know how to use it.
