# Create a Language File for UI

By default, ZSS only displays English on its user interface. You can
create your language translation file for texts in the UI to make it
more user-friendly.

## Create a Language JavaScript File for a Language

Create a new language js file for a specific locale like:

` msgzss_[LANG]_[COUNTRY].js`

e.g. `msgzss_zh_TW.js` is for traditional Chinese in Taiwan.

Put the language js file under the same path in your classpath like:

` WEB-INF/classes/web/js/zss/lang/msgzss_zh_TW.js`

In maven default folder structure, you need to put it under `resources`.

## Get Built-in Language Key

Then, get the built-in language properties, it's under

` zss.jar/web/js/zss/lang/msgzss.js`

Copy the content and paste to your new language js file.

## Translate to Target Language

Replacing string values (English) with the target language. ![

-----

Then, visit a page with a browser in the corresponding language setting.
The result looks like:

![zss-essentials-i18n-chinese1.png](zss-essentials-i18n-chinese1.png
"zss-essentials-i18n-chinese1.png")
![zss-essentials-i18n-chinese2.png](zss-essentials-i18n-chinese2.png
"zss-essentials-i18n-chinese2.png")
![zss-essentials-i18n-chinese3.png](zss-essentials-i18n-chinese3.png
"zss-essentials-i18n-chinese3.png")

# Client-side Rendering Message

When your browser is waiting for a server's response, it will show a
"Processing" message. It's ZK's busy message, it will show different
text according to your browser locale (or specified locale). But if the
browser is busy at client-side rendering, it shows a busy message which
is hard-coded:

![ center](zss-essentials-client-rendering.png " center")

So we have to include a CSS file to override the existing text, please [
check the example
project's](ZK%20Spreadsheet%20Essentials/Download%20Example%20Source%20Code "wikilink")
`WEB-INF/lang-addon.xml`, it includes a css:

``` xml
<stylesheet href="~./css/zss_styles*.css" type="text/css"/>
```
